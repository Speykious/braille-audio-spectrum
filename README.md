# Braille Audio Spectrum in Rust

Hey! This code doesn't work. And if it does, the audio spectrum looks very ugly. So don't expect it to work!

This was an experiment I did in Rust, and it made me learn how to use the cpal library to play some sound on the computer at a low level. But oh boi, there's still a lot to learn. For example, on my current Linux setup, the code just refuses to play sound. It must be a problem in the audio configurations I'm choosing.

As for the FFT part, I just don't know what the hell I'm doing for the most part. I tried to port a javascript code and it didn't work. So if I want to make any kind of audio spectrum in Rust, next time, I'll start by checking my maths just so I can at least understand what I'm doing.
